### Assignment III

Complete the conduit Node APIs.

You can find the backend specifications for APIs at `RealWorld API Spec`

First go through all the endpoints defined in `endpoints markdown file`

Also make sure to return results in json format based on specifications provided at `API response format file`

Keep in mind to follow specifications properly. If a `GET` request in handled on `/api/user`, it should be handled the same in your application. If it have been specified to return a `user`, return user document specified in returned result format.
